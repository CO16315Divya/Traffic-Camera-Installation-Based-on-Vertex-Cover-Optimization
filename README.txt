Developed a system to solve vertex cover optimization problem to minimize the number of cameras at traffic intersections.
Programmed using Inter-Process Communication (IPC) in a driver program to link the output of the randomly generating streets program to Python scripts to the input of the C++ program
Calculated minimum vertex cover using MiniSAT Library (a SAT Solver)
